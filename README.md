## Summary
This is the repositary for Fetch's Mobile SWE Intern Exercies. The app retrevies the target data and stored it into a database using Android's DAO. With that, data could be easily retreived through SQL Queries. 

## Usage
After launching into the main page, press the buttons to retrieve data requested. Please see the following gif as a sample.

To get back the the main page, simply use the back button in Android or press ESC if using an emurator. 

## Important Note
Sometimes a quick operation might make the list page empty. Please get back to the main page and retry.
